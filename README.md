Claatu
======
A clade diversity And host evolution algorithm

Version: Alpha

Overview
--------

Claatu (***CLA***de diversity ***A***nd hos***T*** evol***U***tion algorithm) uses 16S reads clustered into closed reference OTUS from diverse sample sets to search for patterns of coevolution, codiversification and coreness.

Note
----
Claatu is a work in progress and will be undergoing rapid development during the coming months. Growing pains are to be expected. Currently Claatu is a collection of stand alone scripts, however, this will be changing in the near future. A workflow is alsoin development and will be added soon.
